# Error Manager
The Robusto Systems Error Manager is a free, open-source, reusable, asynchronous module for handling LabVIEW errors inside LabVIEW applications.

The Error Manager is a stand-alone, asynchronous LabVIEW module that can help log LabVIEW errors to file, display new error details to the user, and display the chronological or inverse-chronological list of errors that occurred since the module started. The module is framework-agnostic, reusable from project to project, and can keep working even when being “spammed” with many instances of the same error (spam protection functionality). Using the Error Manager in a new application helps ensure out-of-the-box robust and reliable error handling.
